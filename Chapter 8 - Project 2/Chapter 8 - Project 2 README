Project 2: art store 
DifficuLty LEvEL: Intermediate

Overview

Demonstrate your ability to work with PHP by converting Chapter08-project02. html into a PHP file that looks 
similar to that shown in Figure 8.17.

Instructions

1. You have been provided with an HTML file (Chapter08-project02.html) that includes all the necessary markup. 
   Save this file as Chapter08-project02.php.

2. Move the header and footer into two separate include files named art-header. inc.php and art-footer.inc.php. 
   Use the PHP include() function to include each of these files back into the original file.

3. Use a for loop to output the special list (see Figure 8.17).

4. Create a function called outputCartRow() that has the following signature: 
   function outputCartRow($file, $product, $quantity, $price) { }

5. Implement the body of the outputCartRow() function. It should echo the passed information as a table row. 
   Use the number_format() function to format the currency values with two decimal places. 
   Calculate the value for the amount column.

6. Replace the two cart table rows in the original with the following calls:
   outputCartRow($file1, $product1, $quantity1, $price1);
   outputCartRow($file2, $product2, $quantity2, $price2);

7. The above variables are defined in the file art-data.php. You will need to include this file.

8. Calculate the subtotal, tax, shipping, and grand total using PHP. Replace the hard-coded values 
   with your variables that contain the calculations. Use 10 percent as the tax amount. 
   The shipping value will be $100 unless the subtotal is above $2000, in which case it will be $0.

Test
1. Test the page in the browser (see the test section of the previous section to remind yourself about how to do this). 
   Verify that the calculations work appropriately by changing the values in the art-data.php file.
